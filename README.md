## Welcome to ElixirOS

ElixirOS is a lightweight AOSP ROM. We focus on battery, performance and stability, as well as providing the most up-to-date security patches. The philosophy is to stay relatively close to Google's stock Oreo and provide some essential features and configurations to enhance user experience.

### SUPPORTED DEVICES:

- mido
(Redmi Note 4X)(Snapdragon Variant)
